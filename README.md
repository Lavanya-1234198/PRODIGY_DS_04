Tweet ID: Unique identifier for each tweet.
Entity: The specific topic or brand mentioned in the tweet.
Sentiment: The sentiment expressed in the tweet (positive, negative, neutral).
Tweet Content: The text content of the tweet.
Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and duplicates.
Standardize text data for consistency.
Sentiment Analysis:

Analyze the distribution of sentiments across different entities.
Identify trends and patterns in sentiment over time.
Visualization:

Create visualizations to highlight sentiment patterns and trends.
Develop interactive dashboards for dynamic data exploration.
Methodology
Data Cleaning:

Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
Standardized text data using techniques such as lowercasing, removing special characters, and tokenization.
Sentiment Analysis:

Performed sentiment analysis to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
Analyzed the distribution of sentiments for different entities and over time.
Visualization:

Created visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and word clouds to represent sentiment distribution and trends.
Developed interactive dashboards using tools like Plotly and Dash for dynamic exploration of sentiment data.
Key Findings
Sentiment Distribution:

The majority of tweets expressed neutral sentiment, followed by positive and negative sentiments.
Specific entities showed varying sentiment distributions, indicating different public perceptions and attitudes.
Trends Over Time:

Identified peaks and troughs in sentiment over time, corresponding to significant events or changes in public opinion.
Entity-Specific Insights:

Analyzed sentiment for individual entities to understand public opinion and brand perception.
Visualizations
Sentiment Distribution Bar Charts: Display the distribution of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) for different entities.
Trend Line Graphs: Show sentiment trends over time, highlighting significant changes in public opinion.
Word Clouds: Visual representations of the most frequently used words in tweets for different sentiment categories.
